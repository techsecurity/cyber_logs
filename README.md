# cyber_logs
Log and analyse network data
The python script connects to the news database and performs the following 3 sql queries

1. What are the most popular three articles of all time? Which articles have been accessed the most? Present this information as a sorted list with the most popular article at the top.

Example:

"Princess Shellfish Marries Prince Handsome" — 1201 views
"Baltimore Ravens Defeat Rhode Island Shoggoths" — 915 views
"Political Scandal Ends In Political Scandal" — 553 views

2. Who are the most popular article authors of all time? That is, when you sum up all of the articles each author has written, which authors get the most page views? Present this as a sorted list with the most popular author at the top.

Example:

Ursula La Multa — 2304 views
Rudolf von Treppenwitz — 1985 views
Markoff Chaney — 1723 views
Anonymous Contributor — 1023 views


3. On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors? The log table includes a column status that indicates the HTTP status code that the news site sent to the user's browser. (Refer to this lesson for more information about the idea of HTTP status codes.)

Example:

July 29, 2016 — 2.5% errors

CREATE VIEW httplogs to count logs not equql to 200 ok and then use select to take average

Udacity's Installation Instructions:

Installing Python
Hi there! These instructions will walk you through all of the steps needed to install Python onto your computer. This particular page contains instructions for Mac OS X.

NOTE: If you have a Windows PC, please click Previous or otherwise navigate to the previous page in order to find instructions for your particular platform! If you already have Python installed, proceed to the next lesson by clicking on Next.

To install Python on your Mac, you have two options: via the command line using Homebrew, or via the normal Python installer from their website.

Method 1: Package Installer
Go to the Python downloads page that contains downloads for the most recent versions of Python. This course was designed with Python 2 in mind, so choose that installer instead of Python 3.

If you are using Mac OS X 10.6 or later, download the installer linked from that page. If you are using 10.5, you will need an alternate installer, the 32-bit i386/PPC installer.

Open the file that you downloaded. It should either be called python-2.7.12-macosx10.6.pkg or python-2.7.12-macosx10.5.pkg. Note: The images below show Python 2.7.9, but the process is unchanged in more recent versions.

Download the data
Next, download the data here. You will need to unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called newsdata.sql. Put this file into the vagrant directory, which is shared with your virtual machine.

To build the reporting tool, you'll need to load the site's data into your local database. Review how to use the psql command in this lesson: (FSND version)

To load the data, cd into the vagrant directory and use the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql.
Here's what this command does:

psql — the PostgreSQL command line program
-d news — connect to the database named news which has been set up for you
-f newsdata.sql — run the SQL statements in the file newsdata.sql
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file, creating tables and populating them with data.

Getting an error?
If this command gives an error message, such as —
psql: FATAL: database "news" does not exist
psql: could not connect to server: Connection refused
— this means the database server is not running or is not set up correctly. This can happen if you have an older version of the VM configuration from before this project was added. To continue, download the virtual machine configuration into a fresh new directory and start it from there.

Explore the data
Once you have the data loaded into your database, connect to your database using psql -d news and explore the tables using the \dt and \d table commands and select statements.

\dt — display tables — lists the tables that are available in the database.
\d table — (replace table with the name of a table) — shows the database schema for that particular table.
Get a sense for what sort of information is in each column of these tables.

The database includes three tables:

The authors table includes information about the authors of articles.
The articles table includes the articles themselves.
The log table includes one entry for each time a user has accessed the site.
As you explore the data, you may find it useful to take notes! Don't try to memorize all the columns. Instead, write down a description of the column names and what kind of values are found in those columns.

Connecting from your code
The database that you're working with in this project is running PostgreSQL, like the forum database that you worked with in the course. So in your code, you'll want to use the psycopg2 Python module to connect to it, for instance:
cd Downloads\fsnd-virtual-machine\FSND-Virtual-Machine\vagrant>vagrant ssh"




cd /vagrant
cd news
